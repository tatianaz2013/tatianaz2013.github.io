What is the course about? This course explores the bidirectional 
relationship between animal behavior and its endocrine and nervous systems. 
We will begin with an overview of the anatomy and physiology of the nervous and endocrine systems, 
its main glands and hormones. 
Then, we will explore the interplay between specific hormones and behaviors. 
For example, you will learn how prenatal hormones drive the process of sexual differentiation 
into becoming male or female. In the process you will find out if
it is possible to be a male with two X chromosomes or a female with testes. 
We will pose and answer many important questions. For example... Does 
nature really draw a strict line between the sexes or is it our human desire to
categorize and organize that drives this distinction? Are the  
notorious male "promiscuity" and female "chastity" anthropomorphic 
concepts reflect the diversity of animal sexual and reproductive behavior in nature? 
Why and how have peacocks evolved long pretty tails, and why are they considered "handicaps"? 
Are there species where males carry and give birth to the offspring? How did female 
hyena genitalia evolve to look like a male penis? And the penis of a duck to look
like a corkscrew? What happens to you when you are stressed? Why do women have menses? 
How does Viagra work? All these and many other questions are the focus of Behavioral Endocrinology. 
It is a lot of learning, but, i promise: it is fun! You will also be introduced to original 
research in the field of behavioral endocrinology.
