        <p> Hormones and Behavior publishes original research articles, 
        reviews and special issues concerning hormone-brain-behavior relationships, 
        broadly defined. The journal's scope ranges from laboratory and field studies 
        concerning neuroendocrine as well as endocrine mechanisms controlling the
        development or adult expression of behavior to studies concerning the environmental 
        control and evolutionary significance of hormone-behavior relationships. The journal 
        welcomes studies conducted on species ranging from invertebrates to mammals, including humans.
